## Learning Objectives

This project aims at showing use cases where a DevOps mindset is bringing value to a software project by automating it, which decreases the amount of manual work and increases the development speed. It focuses on why automation is useful and helps speeding a development lifecycle.

After this project, you should be able to:

-   Understand the value of automating tedious tasks
-   Define a development lifecycle
-   Automate shell-like tasks with Make, and/or shell script
-   Be aware of tools dependencies and the value of reproducing environment
-   Build static HTML website from Markdown code using Go-Hugo

## Prerequisites

The following elements are required In addition to the previous module (**“Module 0: Linux Fundamentals, Code management with Git, GitHub and the GitFlow pattern”**) prerequisites.


## Lifecycle

A section added for task 2 to describe the different steps.

### Concepts

You should have a basic knowledge of the following concepts:

-   Shell terminal basics, using command lines:
    
    -   Navigating in a Unix file-system
    -   Understanding how stdin/stdout redirection and piping
    -   Showing and searching the content of a text files
    -   Defining and using Environment Variables
    -   Adding command lines to your terminal using the  `apt-get`  package manager and/or with the  `PATH`  variable
    -   Writing and executing a shell script
-   Git with the command line (and also a graphical interface)
    
    -   Retrieving or creating a repository
    -   Manipulating changes locally with Git’s 3 steps process (workspace, staging, history)
    -   Distributing changes history with remotes repositories
-   Make/Makefile usage:
    
    -   Executing tasks through make targets
    -   Default target and PHONY target
    -   Makefile’s variables and macro syntax

### Tooling

This project needs the following tools / services:

### Tooling

This project needs the following tools / services:

-   An HTML5-compliant web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, etc.)
-   A free account on  [GitHub](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/u6680ax-ghu8v-AsFSDbSA "GitHub"), referenced as  `<GitHub Handle>`
-   A shell terminal with  `bash`,  `zsh`  or  `ksh`, including the standard Unix toolset (`ls`,  `cd`, etc.) with:
    -   GNU Make in version 3.81+
    -   Git (command line) in version 2+
    -   [Go Hugo](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/IBEctMMx9WYT-U-G5oIv-g "Go Hugo")  v0.80+
-   The student needs to be able to spawn up a clean Ubuntu 18.04 system. Therefore  [Docker](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/4-LomWsN4dV31c-IwVMwgw "Docker")  is recommended with NO prior knowledge.
-   A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Editor) of your convenience (Visual Code, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ, etc.)

## Story

Congratulations!

It’s your first day at “Awesome Inc.” as a software engineer. This company is currently experiencing fast growth and hired you to work on their web services.

Your predecessor left to travel the world, and the expectations are high on your ability to help "Awesome Inc.” to grow a culture of collaboration with a technical mindset, while managing their existing web services. That’s exactly what DevOps is about!
